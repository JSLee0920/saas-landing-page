# SaaS Landing Page with Next JS, Tailwind CSS, and GSAP

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
# or
bun dev
```
This is a simple SaaS landing page with GSAP animation. 

I used the design and code from Frontend Tribe. Here's the video https://youtu.be/ZZqIR0ru0I4?si=pOhgX_i-zLZmkS6G.

I have made some changes to the code but the design still remain the same.

I use GSAP for the animation instead of using Framer Motion.
